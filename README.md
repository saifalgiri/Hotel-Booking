Background:  
While booking a hotel, there are many restrictions or limitations like maximum number of guests or maximum adults allowed in one room etc.
It’s programmer’s job to translate these restrictions to website/app visitors while booking a hotel room online.  
 
Problem: 
In Hotel Transylvania, each room can only accommodate a maximum of  
 
● 3 adults  AND 
● 3 children  AND 
● 3 infants 
 
● In one booking, maximum guests can be 7(excluding infants)  
● No room will have only children or infants (i.e without at least one adult supervision)
● Per booking maximum number of rooms will be only 3 
● If guests are either greater than 7(excluding infants) or rooms are greater than 3, the booking will be rejected.  
 
Problem:  
Write a program to input number of adults, children and infants to output the mapping of pax per room.
Optimise number of rooms to keep it to minimum.  
 
For example:  
 
For 3 Adults, 4 Children and 2 infants can be fit in 2 rooms and not 3.
